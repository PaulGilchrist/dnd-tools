Its legs end in sharp hooks adapted for burrowing and grasping its prey, and its powerful mandibles can snap a small tree in half.<br/><br/><b>Lurkers in the Earth.</b> The ankheg uses its powerful mandibles to dig winding tunnels deep beneath the ground. When it hunts, an ankheg burrows upward, waiting below the surface until its antennae detect movement from above. Then it bursts from the earth and seizes prey in its mandibles, crushing and grinding while it secretes acidic digestive enzymes. These enzymes help dissolve a victim for easy swallowing, but the ankheg can also squirt acid to take down foes.<br/><br/><b>Bane of Field and Forest.</b> Although ankhegs receive a certain portion of their nutrients from the soil through which they burrow, they must supplement their diet with fresh meat. Pastures teeming with grazing livestock and forests rife with game are an ankheg's prime hunting grounds. Ankhegs are thus the bane of farmers and rangers everywhere.<br/><br/><b>Earthen Tunnels.</b> As it burrows through earth, the ankheg leaves a narrow, partially collapsed tunnel in its wake. In these tunnels, one might find the remnants of molted ankheg chitin, hatched ankheg eggs, or the grisly remains of ankheg victims, including coins or other treasures scattered during the creature's attack.","environments":["forest","grassland"],"image":true,"page":21},{"index":"ape","name":"Ape","size":"Medium","type":"beast","subtype":null,"alignment":"unaligned","armor_class":12,"hit_points":19,"hit_dice":"3d8","speed":{"walk":"30 ft.","climb":"30 ft."},"strength":16,"dexterity":14,"constitution":14,"intelligence":6,"wisdom":12,"charisma":7,"proficiencies":[{"value":5,"name":"Skill: Athletics"},{"value":3,"name":"Skill: Perception"}],"damage_vulnerabilities":[],"damage_resistances":[],"damage_immunities":[],"condition_immunities":[],"senses":{"passive_perception":13},"languages":"","challenge_rating":0.5,"xp":100,"actions":[{"name":"Multiattack","desc":"The ape makes two fist attacks."},{"name":"Fist","desc":"Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

The warriors of the court selectively bred the beasts to reinforce their ferocious and predatory nature, using them to hunt unicorns, pegasi, and other wondrous prey. However, it didn't take long for the displacer beasts to use their malevolent intelligence to escape their masters.<br/>Running and breeding freely in the Feywild, the displacer beasts soon came to the attention of the Seelie Court. With blink dog companions at their side, fey hunters drove these predators to the fringes of the Feywild, where many crossed over to the Material Plane. To this day, displacer beasts and blink dogs attack each other on sight.<br/><br/><b>Love of the Kill.</b> Displacer beasts kill not just for food but also for sport. They target prey even when not hungry, often toying with their victims to entertain themselves until they are ready to eat. After killing its prey using its tentacles, a displacer beast drags the corpse to a quiet place where it can feed without distraction.<br/>Displacer beasts hunt alone or in small prides that demonstrate skill at setting ambushes. A single beast will strike and withdraw, luring prey into a densely wooded area where its packmates wait. Packs of displacer beasts hunting near trade roads recall the frequency and schedule of regular caravans, laying down ambushes to pick off those caravans.<br/><br/><b>Prized Guards and Pets.</b> Intelligent evil creatures favor displacer beasts as pets, but a displacer beast enters such an alliance only if it appears beneficial.

Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.\nWishes.\nThe genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.\nTo be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect.

Whatever she demands, the drow do.<br/>The wickedest of elves, drow are seldom seen by the surface world. Though they plot to destroy the elves that banished them, they no longer see themselves as exiles. They are the destined rulers of the darkness, and when Lolth commands them to rise up and destroy their surface-dwelling kin, they will.<br/><br/><b>Creatures of Darkness.</b> The drow have lived underground for so long that they have evolved to their surroundings and can see in the dark. However, they can no longer stand sunlight. When slaves are in short supply in the Underdark, the drow send raiding parties to the surface to capture humanoids under cover of darkness, bringing them back to their cities to be tortured into submission. Beyond those occasional excursions, the drow are content to remain in their subterranean realm, where they feel secure and in control.<br/><br/><b>Underdark Cities.</b> The dark elves build fantastic cities in enormous caverns where food and water are abundant. Their ability to sculpt stone rivals that of the greatest dwarf artisans, yet their structures retain a decidedly elven aesthetic. Though appearing delicate, drow settlements are structurally sound and remarkably resilient. The drow like to hollow out enormous stalagmites and stalactites, creating populated spires that rise from the floors and ceilings.<br/>A drow city is a sprawling metropolis enclosed by high walls. Non-drow visitors must conduct their business outside the walls under watchful eyes. The drow raise and keep giant spiders to help protect their cities against intruders, even as they drape those cities in beautiful webbing, creating a gossamer snare to catch flying enemies that would otherwise soar over the walls.<br/><br/><b>Drow Magic.</b> Just as the drow have adapted to underground life, so too has their magic. In addition to using that magic to carve their cities from stone, they empower their weapons, create dangerous new magic items, and summon demons from the Abyss. Drow spellcasters are supremely arrogant and never hesitate to use their magic in the most abhorrent ways.<br/><br/><b>Arms and Armor.</b> Drow craft weapons made of adamantine, a dark and supernaturally hard metal. Drow artisans adorn their weapons and armor with web-like filigree and spider motifs, and mages sometimes imbue items with magic to enhance their effectiveness. However, such magic fades when exposed to sunlight, so that magical drow weapons and armor rarely retain their enhancement bonuses and magical properties when brought to the surface.<br/><br/><b>Cutthroat Politics.</b> Drow politics are cutthroat and rife with intrigue. When drowworktogether, it is typically to destroy a common foe and ensure their own survival, and such alliances are short lived and fraught with peril.<br/>Drow society is divided into noble houses, each ruled by a matron who seeks to raise the prestige and power of her house above all others. Other high-ranking members of the house are blood relatives, while the middling ranks are flush with drow from weaker families that have sworn fealty to the greater house. Clinging precariously to the bottom rung of a house's social ladder are the house slaves, made up of drow of low birth and the occasional non-drow captive.<br/><br/><b>Matriarchal Rule.</b> Lolth, through her faithful priestesses, dictates the rules of drow society, ensuring that her orders and plots are carried out. Since Lolth is prone to manifesting on the Material Plane and directly punishing those that disobey her, the drow have learned to heed what she says and do as her priestesses command.<br/>In drow society, males are subservient to females. A male drow might lead an Underdark patrol or a raiding party to the surface, but he reports to a female drow-either the matron of his house or one of her hand-picked female subordinates. Although male drow can fill almost any function in drow society, they can't be priests, nor can they rule a house.<br/><br/><b>Poison Predilection.</b> Distilled from spider venom and the flora of the Underdark, poison can be found in abundance among the drow, and it plays an important part in their culture and politics. Drow mages concoct a viscid toxin that leaves enemies unconscious. Drow warriors coat their blades and crossbow bolts with this venom, looking forward to the interrogation and torture that follows combat.","environments":["underdark"],"page":126},{"index":"drow-gunslinger","name":"Drow Gunslinger","size":"Medium","type":"humanoid (elf)","subtype":null,"alignment":"any alignment","armor_class":18,"hit_points":84,"hit_dice":"13d8 + 26","speed":{"walk":"30 ft."},"strength":13,"dexterity":18,"constitution":14,"intelligence":11,"wisdom":13,"charisma":14,"proficiencies":[{"value":6,"name":"Saving Throw: DEX"},{"value":4,"name":"Saving Throw: CON"},{"value":3,"name":"Saving Throw: WIS"},{"value":3,"name":"Skill: Preception"},{"value":8,"name":"Skill: Stealth"}],"damage_vulnerabilities":[],"damage_resistances":[],"damage_immunities":[],"condition_immunities":[],"senses":{"passive_perception":15},"languages":"Elvish, Undercommon","challenge_rating":4,"xp":1100,"special_abilities":[{"name":"Fey Ancestry","desc":"The drow has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put the drow to sleep."},{"name":"Gunslinger","desc":"Beingwithin5feetofahostilecreatureorattack· ing at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on the drow's ranged attack rolls with a pistol.

Using ancient dwarven knowledge and myriad slaves, they work tirelessly to expand their subterranean kingdoms.<br/>Most duergar (including females) are bald and have ashen gray skin. They wear drab clothing designed to blend in with stone, along with simple jewelry that reflects their severe and utilitarian demeanor.<br/><br/><b>Slaves to Slavers.</b> The duergar were once dwarves, before their greed and endless delving beneath the earth brought them into contact with the mind flayers. Held in captivity for generations by the illithids, the dwarves eventually won their independence with the aid of the evil god Laduguer. Slavery had forever changed them, however, darkening their spirits to make the duergar as evil as the tyrants they had escaped. Despite winning their freedom, duergar are dour, pessimistic, untrusting creatures, always toiling and complaining, with no memory of what it means to be happy or proud. Their craftsmanship and accomplishments endure, yet they are bereft of warmth or artistry.<br/>Duergar make war against their dwarven kin and all other subterranean races.

It never bathes if it can help it, and its thick skin is usually encrusted with a thick layer of dirt and grime beneath the stinking hides it wears. Its long stringy hair hangs in an unkempt mess about its faces, and its breath reeks from mouths filled with crooked teeth and tusks.<br/><br/><b>Dual Personality.</b> The twin heads of an ettin are two individuals trapped in the same brutish body. Each head has its own mind, personality, and name, and possesses unique preferences and quirks. Bound from birth, both minds only rarely experience privacy or solitude. This familiarity breeds contempt, and an ettin bullies and argues with itself constantly, its two heads each taking constant offense at the other's slights.<br/>When other creatures refer to an ettin, they combine its double names to form a single compound name that applies to the creature as a whole. If an ettin has one head named Hargle and another named Vargle, other creatures call the ettin Harglevargle.<br/><br/><b>Solitary Lives.</b> As much as an ettin argues with itself, it is even less tolerant of other ettins, since a conversation between two ettins almost always amounts to a shouting match between a crowd of four belligerent heads. Most ettins are solitary creatures as a result, tolerating one another only to reproduce.<br/>An ettin's twin heads are always the same gender, with a body to match. Females are the dominant gender among ettins, and they initiate the ettins' mating rituals. After finding a suitable den, a female ettin hunts and conquers a male, which cares for and feeds her during her six­ month pregnancy. Once the child is born, the male ettin is released from servitude. When the child is old enough to hunt for itself, the mother sends it away and abandons the den.<br/><br/><b>Two Heads are Better than One.</b> When focused on a mutually beneficial purpose or united by a common threat, an ettin can resolve its personality differences and dedicate itself fully to a task. An ettin fights with a weapon in each hand, making twin attacks directed by its respective heads. When an ettin sleeps, one of its heads remains ever alert, gaining its only moments of privacy and keeping two eyes open for any creature that disturbs its precious solitude.<br/><br/><b>Orcish Ties.</b> In ancient dialects of Common, the word \"ettin\" translates as \"ugly giant.\" Legends tell of ores that once stumbled upon a temple to Demogorgon, the magic of which transformed them into giant mockeries of the twin-headed Prince of Demons. Driven to near madness, these creatures scattered into the wilderness to become the first ettins.<br/>Whatever the truth of the ettins' origin, ores treat them as distant cousins, and ore tribes often entice ettins to serve as guards, scouts, and marauders. An ettin isn't particularly loyal to its ore handlers, but the ores can win it over with the promise of food and loot.","environments":["hill","mountain","underdark"],"image":true,"page":132},{"index":"fire-elemental","name":"Fire Elemental","size":"Large","type":"elemental","subtype":null,"alignment":"neutral","armor_class":13,"hit_points":102,"hit_dice":"12d10","speed":{"walk":"50 ft."},"strength":10,"dexterity":17,"constitution":16,"intelligence":6,"wisdom":10,"charisma":7,"proficiencies":[],"damage_vulnerabilities":[],"damage_resistances":["bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical weapons"],"damage_immunities":["fire","poison"],"condition_immunities":["exhaustion","grappled","paralyzed","petrified","poisoned","prone","restrained","unconscious"],"senses":{"darkvision":"60 ft.","passive_perception":10},"languages":"Ignan","challenge_rating":5,"xp":1800,"special_abilities":[{"name":"Fire Form","desc":"The elemental can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

Packs of ordinary hyenas followed in his wake, scavenging the demon lord's kills. Those hyenas were transformed into the first gnolls, parading after Yeenoghu until he was banished back to the Abyss. The gnolls then scattered across the face of the world, a dire reminder of demonic power.<br/><br/><b>Nomadic Destroyers.</b> Gnolls are dangerous because they strike at random. They emerge from the wilderness, plunder and slaughter, then move elsewhere. They attack like a plague of locusts, pillaging settlements and leaving little behind but razed buildings, gnawed corpses, and befouled land. Gnolls choose easy targets for their raids. Armored warriors holed up in a fortified castle will survive a rampaging gnoll horde unscathed, even as the towns, villages, and farms that surround the castle are ablaze, their people slaughtered and devoured.<br/>Gnolls rarely build permanent structures or craft anything of lasting value. They don't make weapons or armor, but scavenge such items from the corpses of their fallen victims, stringing ears, teeth, scalps, and other trophies from their foes onto their patchwork armor.<br/><br/><b>Thirst for Blood.</b> No goodness or compassion resides in the heart of a gnoll. Like a demon, it lacks anything resembling a conscience, and can't be taught or coerced to put aside its destructive tendencies. The gnolls' frenzied bloodlust makes them an enemy to all, and when they lack a common foe, they fight among themselves.

Individually weak, goblins gather in large-sometimes overwhelming-numbers. They crave power and regularly abuse whatever authority they obtain.<br/><br/><b>Goblinoids.</b> Goblins belong to a family of creatures called goblinoids. Their larger cousins, hobgoblins and bugbears, like to bully goblins into submission. Goblins are lazy and undisciplined, making them poor servants, laborers, and guards.<br/><br/><b>Malicious Glee.</b> Motivated by greed and malice, goblins can't help but celebrate the few times they have the upper hand. They dance, caper with sheer joy when victory is theirs. Once their revels have ended, goblins delight in the torment of other creatures and embrace all manner of wickedness.<br/><br/><b>Leaders and Followers.</b> Goblins are ruled by the strongest or smartest among them. A goblin boss might command a single lair, while a goblin king or queen (who is nothing more than a glorified goblin boss) rules hundreds of goblins, spread out among multiple lairs to ensure the tribe's survival. Goblin bosses are easily ousted, and many goblin tribes are taken over by hobgoblin warlords or bugbear chiefs.<br/><br/><b>Challenging Lairs.</b> Goblins festoon their lairs with alarms designed to signal the arrival of intruders. Those lairs are also riddled with narrow tunnels and bolt-holes that human-sized creatures can't navigate, but which goblins can crawl through with ease, allowing them to flee or to circle around and surprise their enemies.<br/><br/><b>Rat Keepers and WolfRiders.</b> Goblins have an affinity for rats and wolves, raising them to serve as companions and mounts, respectively. Like rats, goblins shun sunlight and sleep underground during the day. Like wolves, they are pack hunters, made bolder by their numbers. When they hunt from the backs of wolves, goblins use hit-and-run attacks.<br/><br/><b>Worshipers of Maglubiyet.</b> Maglubiyet the Mighty One, the Lord of Depths and Darkness, is the greater god of goblinoids. Envisioned by most goblins as an eleven-foot-tall battle-scarred goblin with black skin and fire erupting from his eyes, he is worshiped not out of adoration but fear. Goblins believe that when they die in battle, their spirits join the ranks of Maglubiyet's army on the plane ofAcheron. This is a \"privilege\" that most goblins dread, fearing the Mighty One's eternal tyranny even more than death.","environments":["forest","grassland","hill","underdark"],"image":true,"page":165,"related_monsters":[{"index":"hobgoblin","name":"Hobgoblin"},{"index":"worg","name":"Worg"}]},{"index":"gold-dragon-wyrmling","name":"Gold Dragon Wyrmling","size":"Medium","type":"dragon","subtype":null,"alignment":"lawful good","armor_class":17,"hit_points":60,"hit_dice":"8d8","speed":{"walk":"30 ft.","fly":"60 ft.","swim":"30 ft."},"strength":19,"dexterity":14,"constitution":17,"intelligence":14,"wisdom":11,"charisma":16,"proficiencies":[{"value":4,"name":"Saving Throw: DEX"},{"value":5,"name":"Saving Throw: CON"},{"value":2,"name":"Saving Throw: WIS"},{"value":5,"name":"Saving Throw: CHA"},{"value":4,"name":"Skill: Perception"},{"value":4,"name":"Skill: Stealth"}],"damage_vulnerabilities":[],"damage_resistances":[],"damage_immunities":["fire"],"condition_immunities":[],"senses":{"blindsight":"10 ft.","darkvision":"60 ft.","passive_perception":14},"languages":"Draconic","challenge_rating":3,"xp":700,"special_abilities":[{"name":"Amphibious","desc":"The dragon can breathe air and water."}],"actions":[{"name":"Bite","desc":"Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

However, such training is time consuming, expensive (mostly for the ample food the creature requires), and dangerous. Expert trainers well versed in the griffon's legendary ferocity are typically the only ones able to raise these creatures safely.<br/>Once trained, a griffon is a fierce and loyal steed. It bonds with one master for life, fighting to the death to protect that rider. A griffon mount retains its ravenous appetite for horseflesh, and a wise master ensures that a griffon remains satiated with other prey when passing through civilized lands.","environments":["arctic","coastal","grassland","hill","mountain"],"image":true,"page":174},{"index":"grimlock","name":"Grimlock","size":"Medium","type":"humanoid","subtype":"grimlock","alignment":"neutral evil","armor_class":11,"hit_points":11,"hit_dice":"2d8","speed":{"walk":"30 ft."},"strength":16,"dexterity":12,"constitution":12,"intelligence":9,"wisdom":8,"charisma":6,"proficiencies":[{"value":5,"name":"Skill: Athletics"},{"value":3,"name":"Skill: Perception"},{"value":3,"name":"Skill: Stealth"}],"damage_vulnerabilities":[],"damage_resistances":[],"damage_immunities":[],"condition_immunities":["blinded"],"senses":{"blindsight":"30 ft. or 10 ft. while deafened (blind beyond this radius)","passive_perception":13},"languages":"Undercommon","challenge_rating":0.25,"xp":50,"special_abilities":[{"name":"Blind Senses","desc":"The grimlock can't use its blindsight while deafened and unable to smell."},{"name":"Keen Hearing and Smell","desc":"The grimlock has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell."},{"name":"Stone Camouflage","desc":"The grimlock has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in rocky terrain."}],"actions":[{"name":"Spiked Bone Club","desc":"Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

Among those were human cultures whose high priests the mind flayers subverted using their insidious powers of thought control. Those leaders gradually turned the faiths of their followers toward the illithids, which they worshiped as blasphemous deities.<br/>Over time, the rituals of these enslaved humans created fervent cannibal cults that regarded the brain eating of the mind flayers as a holy sacrament. The illithids commanded their worshipers to abduct other sentient creatures to be sacrificed. After the victims' brains had been consumed, the mind flayers gave the lifeless bodies to the cultists.<br/><br/><b>Blind Hunters.</b> When the rule of the mind flayers crumbled, their cults faced constant warfare from their enemies, the same creatures that had once been their victims.

Its sweet song has lured countless adventurers to their deaths, drawing them in close for the harpy to kill and then consume.<br/>A harpy combines the body, legs, and wings of a vulture with the torso, arms, and head of a human. Its wicked talons and bone club make it a formidable threat in combat, and its eyes reflect the absolute evil of its soul.<br/><br/><b>Divine Curse.</b> Long ago, an elf wandering a forest heard birdsong so pure and wholesome that she was moved to tears. Following the music, she came upon a clearing where stood a handsome elf youth who had also paused to hear the bird's song. This was Fenmarel Mestarine, a reclusive elf god. His divine presence stole her heart as he fled, vanishing into the woods as if he was never there.<br/>Though the elf searched the woods and called for her stranger, she found no sign of his passage. Driven to despair by her longing, she begged the gods to help her. Aerdrie Faenya, elf goddess of the sky, heard the elf's cries and was moved to her aid. She appeared as the bird whose song had entranced the outcast god, then taught that song of beauty and seduction to the elf.<br/>When her singing failed to draw Fenmarel Mestarine to her side, the elf cursed the gods, invoking a dreadful power and transforming her into the first harpy. The curse worked its magic on the elf's spirit as well as her body, turning her desire for love into a hunger for flesh, even as her beautiful song continued to draw creatures to her deadly embrace.<br/><br/><b>Harpy Song.</b> To hear a harpy's song is to hear music more beautiful than anything else in the world. A traveler that succumbs to the entrancing effect of that singing is compelled to blunder toward its source. A harpy sometimes charms victims before it attacks, but a more effective use of its song is to lure prey over cliffs, into bogs and quicksand, or into deadly pits. Creatures trapped or incapacitated then become easy targets for the harpy's wrath.<br/><br/><b>Sadistic Cowards.</b> Harpies haunt bleak coastal cliffs and other places hazardous to non-flying creatures. Harpies have no interest in a fair fight, and they never attack unless they have a clear advantage. If a fight turns against a harpy, it lacks the cunning to adapt and will flee and go hungry rather than risk straight-up combat.<br/>When they attack, harpies play with their food, delighting in the \"music\" their victims make as they scream. A harpy takes its time dismembering a helpless foe and can spend days torturing a victim before the merciful end.<br/><br/><b>Gruesome Collectors.</b> Harpies take shiny baubles, valuable objects, and other trophies from their victims, sometimes fighting with each other for the right to claim the choicest prizes. When no valuable objects can be found, a harpy takes hair, bones, or body parts to line its nest. A harpy's lair is usually hidden in remote ruins, where adventurers can discover valuable treasure and magic hidden beneath foul piles of offal.","environments":["coastal","forest","hill","mountain"],"image":true,"page":181},{"index":"hawk","name":"Hawk","size":"Tiny","type":"beast","subtype":null,"alignment":"unaligned","armor_class":13,"hit_points":1,"hit_dice":"1d4","speed":{"walk":"10 ft.","fly":"60 ft."},"strength":5,"dexterity":16,"constitution":8,"intelligence":2,"wisdom":14,"charisma":6,"proficiencies":[{"value":4,"name":"Skill: Perception"}],"damage_vulnerabilities":[],"damage_resistances":[],"damage_immunities":[],"condition_immunities":[],"senses":{"passive_perception":14},"languages":"","challenge_rating":0,"xp":10,"special_abilities":[{"name":"Keen Sight","desc":"The hawk has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight."}],"actions":[{"name":"Talons","desc":"Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

They blunder through hills and forests devouring what they can, bullying smaller creatures into feeding them. Their laziness and dullness would long ago have spelled their end if not for their formidable size and strength.<br/><br/><b>Primitive.</b> Hill giants dwell in hills and mountain valleys across the world, congregating in steadings built of rough timber or in clusters of well-defended mud­ and-wattle huts. Their skins are tan from lives spent lumbering up and down the hilly slopes and dozing beneath the sun. Their weapons are uprooted trees and rocks pulled from the earth. The sweat of their bodies adds to the reek of the crude animal skins they wear, poorly stitched together with hair and leather thongs.<br/><br/><b>Bigger Means Better.</b> In a hill giant's world, humanoids and animals are easy prey that can be hunted with impunity. Creatures such as dragons and other giants are tough adversaries. Hill giants equate size with power.<br/>Hill giants don't realize they follow an ordning. They know only that other giants are larger and stronger than they are, which means they are to be obeyed. A hill giant tribe's chief is usually the tallest and fattest giant that can still move about. Only on rare occasion does a hill giant with more brains than bulk use its cunning to gain the favor of giants of higher status, cleverly subverting the social order.<br/><br/><b>Voracious Eaters.</b> With nothing else to occupy them, hill giants eat as often as possible. A hill giant hunts and forages alone or with a dire wolf companion, so as to not have to share with other tribe members. The giant eats anything that isn't obviously deadly, such as creatures known to be poisonous. Rotten meat is fair game, though, as are decaying plants and even mud.<br/>Farmers fear and loathe hill giants. Where a predator such as an ankheg might burrow through fields and consume a cow or two before being driven off, a hill giant will consume a whole herd of cattle before moving on to sheep, goats, and chickens, then tearing into fruits, vegetables, and grain. If a farm family is at hand, the giant might snack on them too.<br/><br/><b>Stupid and Deadly.</b> The hill giants' ability to digest nearly anything has allowed them to survive for eons as savages, eating and breeding in the hills like animals. They have never needed to adapt and change, so their minds and emotions remain simple and undeveloped.<br/>With no culture of their own, hill giants ape the traditions of creatures they manage to observe for a time before eating them. They don't think about their own size and strength, however. Tribes of hill giants attempting to imitate elves have been known to topple entire forests by trying to live in trees. Others attempting to take over humanoid towns or villages get only as far as the doors and windows of a building, taking out its walls and roof as they attempt to enter.<br/>In conversation, hill giants are blunt and direct, and they have little concept of deception. A hill giant might be fooled into running from another giant if a number of villagers cover themselves in blankets and stand on one another's shoulders holding a giant-painted pumpkin head. Reasoning with a hill giant is futile, although clever creatures can sometimes encourage a giant to take actions that benefit them.<br/><br/><b>Raging Bullies.</b> A hill giant that feels as though it has been deceived, insulted, or made into a fool vents its terrible wrath on anything it encounters. Even after smashing those who offended it into pulp, the giant rampages until its rage abates, it notices something more interesting, or it grows hungry.<br/>If a hill giant proclaims itself king over a territory where other humanoids Jive, it rules strictly by terror and tyranny.

Across the borderlands of civilization, settlements and settlers must contend with these aggressive humanoids, whose thirst for conquest is never satisfied.<br/>Hobgoblins have dark orange or red-orange skin, and hair ranging from dark red-brown to dark gray. Yellow or dark brown eyes peer out beneath their beetling brows, and their wide mouths sport sharp and yellowed teeth. A male hobgoblin might have a large blue or red nose, which symbolizes virility and power among goblinkin. Hobgoblins can live as long as humans, though their love of warfare and battle means that few do.<br/><br/><b>Goblinoids.</b> Hobgoblins belong to a family of creatures called goblinoids. They are often found lording over their cousins, the smaller goblins and the ferocious bugbears.<br/><br/><b>Martial Might.</b> A hobgoblin measures virtue by physical strength and martial prowess, caring about nothing except the opportunity to demonstrate skill and cunning in battle. Hobgoblins of high military rank attain their positions by force, then hold those positions by imposing their authority through draconian measures.<br/>Hobgoblins train to fight with a variety of weapons, and have great skill at crafting arms, armor, siege engines, and other military devices. Organized and disciplined, they take exceptional care of their weapons, armor, and personal possessions. They favor the bold colors associated with their tribes, and trim their often-elaborate uniforms with blood-red piping and leather dyed black.<br/><br/><b>Military Legions.</b> Hobgoblins organize themselves into tribal bands known as legions. In their martial society, every hobgoblin has a rank, from the powerful leaders and champions, to the rank-and-file foot soldiers, to the goblins that find themselves driven into the front lines at spear point. A legion is headed by a warlord with several captains serving under its command. A hobgoblin warlord is a ruthless tyrant more interested in strategy, victory, glory, reputation, and dominion than leading troops into battle.<br/>As loyal and disciplined as hobgoblins are in their own legion, rival legions compete constantly for reputation and status. Meetings between legions erupt in violence if troops aren't restrained, and only exceptionally powerful leaders can force legions to cooperate on the battlefield.<br/><br/><b>Strategic Thinkers.</b> Hobgoblins have a strong grasp of tactics and discipline, and can carry out sophisticated battle plans under the direction of a strategically minded leader. However, they hate elves and attack them first in battle over any other opponents, even if doing so would be a tactical error.<br/>Legions often supplement their ranks with less reliable and more expendable troops, including goblins, bugbears, ores, evil humans, ogres, and giants.<br/><br/><b>Beast Trainers.</b> Hobgoblins have a long history of training animals to service. Like the more civilized races, they use oxen and horses to transport goods and weaponry over long distances. They communicate with each other using trained ravens, and keep vicious wolves to guard prisoners and protect hobgoblin camps. Hobgoblin cavalry use trained worgs as steeds, in the same way that goblins ride wolves. Some tribes even keep carnivorous apes as fighting beasts.<br/><br/><b>Conquer and Control.</b> Hobgoblins claim lands with abundant resources, and they can be found in forests and mountains, near mines and humanoid settlements, and anywhere else that wood, metal, and potential slaves can be found. They build and conquer strongholds in strategically advantageous locations, which they then use as staging areas to expand their territory.<br/>Hobgoblin warlords never tire of combat, but they don't take up arms lightly. Before they attack, hobgoblins conduct thorough reconnaissance to gauge the strengths and weaknesses of their foes. When assaulting a stronghold, they surround it first to cut off escape routes and supply lines, then slowly starve their enemies out.<br/>Hobgoblins fortify their own holdings, bolstering existing defenses with innovations of their own. Whether they lair in cavern complexes, dungeons, ruins, or forests, they protect their strongholds with ditches, fences, gates, guard towers, pit traps, and crude catapults or ballistas.<br/><br/><b>Legion of Maglubiyet.</b> Hobgoblins worship Maglubiyet the Mighty One, the greater god of goblinoids. As terrifying as this figure is, hobgoblins don't fear death, believing that when they die in battle, their spirits join the honored ranks of Maglubiyet's army on the plane of Acheron.","environments":["desert","forest","grassland","hill","underdark"],"image":true,"page":185,"related_monsters":[{"index":"goblin","name":"Goblin"},{"index":"worg","name":"Worg"}]},{"index":"homunculus","name":"Homunculus","size":"Tiny","type":"construct","subtype":null,"alignment":"neutral","armor_class":13,"hit_points":5,"hit_dice":"2d4","speed":{"walk":"20 ft.","fly":"40 ft."},"strength":4,"dexterity":15,"constitution":11,"intelligence":10,"wisdom":10,"charisma":7,"proficiencies":[],"damage_vulnerabilities":[],"damage_resistances":[],"damage_immunities":["poison"],"condition_immunities":["charmed","poisoned"],"senses":{"darkvision":"60 ft.","passive_perception":10},"languages":"understands the languages of its creator but can't speak","challenge_rating":0,"xp":10,"special_abilities":[{"name":"Telepathic Bond","desc":"While the homunculus is on the same plane of existence as its master, it can magically convey what it senses to its master, and the two can communicate telepathically."}],"actions":[{"name":"Bite","desc":"Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.

They can perfectly imitate any sound they hear.<br/>Fallen Flocks. Kenku wear ill-fitting cloaks, robes, and rags. These garments cover the soft, sleek feathers of their bodies, shrouding their bare arms and legs. They tread lightly when they walk, on talons made for grasping the branches of trees and seizing prey from the lofty skies. Soft as the wind they move, so as not to draw attention to their shameful forms.<br/>Once, the kenku held the wind in their wings, embracing the gusty sky and singing the sweet language of birdsong. Serving a master whose identity is now lost to their memory, the kenku coveted the glittering baubles of his household, and longed to speak so that they could cajole and swindle others out of such treasures. Stealing the secret of speech from a volume in their master's library, they disguised themselves in rags to beg for pretty things. When their master learned of their greed, he stripped away their wings as punishment, forcing them to beg forever.<br/><br/><b>Speech in Pantomime.</b> Kenku can mimic the sound of anything they hear. A kenku asking for money might make the sound of coins clinking together, and a kenku referring to a busy marketplace can reproduce the cacophony of hawking vendors, barking dogs, bleating sheep, and the cries of street urchins. When mimicking voices, they can only repeat words and phrases they have heard, not create new sentences. To converse with a kenku is to witness a performance of imitated sounds and almost nonsensical verse.<br/>Kenku speak to one another in much the same way. Because they are adept at interpreting one another's glances and gestures, the sounds they make to communicate complex ideas or emotions can be succinct. Groups of kenku also develop secret codes. For example, a cat's meow might be the secret code for \"Prepare to attack!\" or \"Flee for your lives!\"<br/>Their talent for mimicry extends to handwriting, and criminal organizations often employ kenku to forge documents. When a kenku commits a crime, it might forge evidence to implicate another creature.<br/><br/><b>The Wistful Wingless.</b> All kenku pine for the ability to fly, and thus the punishments they mete out to one another often involve false wings, such as heavy wings of wood borne as a mark of shame.

Kobolds inhabit dragons' lairs when they can but more commonly infest dungeons, gathering treasures and trinkets to add to their own tiny hoards.<br/><br/><b>Strength in Numbers.</b> Kobolds are egg-laying creatures. They mature quickly and can live to be \"great wyrms\" more than a century old. However, many kobolds perish before they reach the end of their first decade. Physically weak, they are easy prey for predators. This vulnerability forces them to band together. Their superior numbers can win battles against powerful adversaries, but often with massive casualties on the kobold side.<br/><br/><b>Tunnelers and Builders.</b> Kobolds make up for their physical ineptitude with a cleverness for trap making and tunneling. Their lairs consist of low tunnels through which they move easily but which hinder larger humanoids. Kobolds also riddle their lairs with traps. The most insidious kobold traps make use of natural hazards and other creatures. A trip wire might connect to a spring-loaded trap that hurls clay pots of flesh­ eating green slime or flings crates of venomous giant centipedes at intruders.<br/><br/><b>The Lost God.</b> In addition to the dragons they revere, kobolds worship a lesser god named Kurtulmak. Legends speak of how Kurtulmak served as Tiamat's vassal in the Nine Hells until Gari Glittergold, the god of gnomes, stole a trinket from the Dragon Queen's hoard. Tiamat sent Kurtulmak to retrieve the trinket, but Gari Glittergold played a trick on him, collapsing the earth and trapping the kobold god in an underground maze for eternity. For this reason, kobolds hate gnomes and pranks of any kind. Kurtulmak's most devoted worshipers dedicate themselves to finding and releasing their lost god from his prison-maze.<br/><br/><b>Winged Kobolds.</b> A few kobolds are born with leathery wings and can fly. Known as urds, they like to lurk on high ledges and drop rocks on passersby. Although the urds' wings are seen as gifts from Tiamat, the Dragon Queen, wingless kobolds are envious of those gifts and don't get along with the urds.","environments":["arctic","coastal","desert","forest","hill","mountain","Swamp","underdark","urban"],"image":true,"page":195},{"index":"kraken","name":"Kraken","size":"Gargantuan","type":"monstrosity","subtype":"titan","alignment":"chaotic evil","armor_class":18,"hit_points":472,"hit_dice":"27d20","speed":{"walk":"20 ft.","swim":"60 ft."},"strength":30,"dexterity":11,"constitution":25,"intelligence":22,"wisdom":18,"charisma":20,"proficiencies":[{"value":17,"name":"Saving Throw: STR"},{"value":7,"name":"Saving Throw: DEX"},{"value":14,"name":"Saving Throw: CON"},{"value":13,"name":"Saving Throw: INT"},{"value":11,"name":"Saving Throw: WIS"}],"damage_vulnerabilities":[],"damage_resistances":[],"damage_immunities":["lightning","bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical weapons"],"condition_immunities":["frightened","paralyzed"],"senses":{"truesight":"120 ft.","passive_perception":14},"languages":"understands Abyssal, Celestial, Infernal, and Primordial but can't speak, telepathy 120 ft.","challenge_rating":23,"xp":50000,"special_abilities":[{"name":"Amphibious","desc":"The kraken can breathe air and water."},{"name":"Freedom of Movement","desc":"The kraken ignores difficult terrain, and magical effects can't reduce its speed or cause it to be restrained.

Kuo-toa can no longer abide daylight.<br/><br/><b>Mad Slaves.</b> At the height of the illithid empire, the mind flayers captured kuo-toa by the thousands and forced them into bondage. The kuo-toa were simple creatures, never meant to endure the oppressive mental force the illithids unleashed against them. By the time the mind flayers abandoned them, the prolonged psychic subjugation endured by the kuo-toa had driven them mad.<br/>Their minds shattered beyond repair, the kuo-toa adopted a religious fervor, inventing gods to protect them against threats. Most notable of these threats are the drow, which have slain the kuo-toa on sight since the days when the two races first met.<br/><br/><b>God Makers.</b> Kuo-toa worship gods of their own insane creation, but if enough kuo-toa believe that a god is real, the energy of their collective subconscious can cause that god to manifest as a physical entity. The form a kuo-toa god takes depends on the inspiration for its divine image, and is usually random or nonsensical.<br/>One of the most revered gods of the kuo-toa is Blibdoolpoolp the Sea Mother, who takes the form of a female human with a crayfish head, a crayfish's claws, and an articulated shell covering her shoulders. Blibdoolpoolp was likely invented by a kuo-toa that improved on a broken human statue by adding the limbs and head of a crustacean. In sudden awe of its handiwork, it then named the resulting form a god.<br/>Kuo-toa that cross paths with an aboleth often find themselves worshiping it as a god, their madness blinding them to the fact that the aboleth is merely using them for its own nefarious ends.<br/><br/><b>Theocratic Rulers.</b> Kuo-toa archpriests are surrounded by fanatical devotees of their faith. The archpriest of a kuo-toa domain demands that all its subjects worship a specific god. An archpriest's mad belief in its god is so fervent that it manifests the powers of a high cleric. The archpriest can also bestow spells to devout underlings called whips. One or more of these whips are also the archpriest's children, and their primary role in kuo-toan society is to fight to the death to claim the throne when the archpriest dies. If a whip displeases the archpriest, the archpriest can strip it of its spellcasting ability, if not its life.<br/>The archpriest's decrees are enforced by monitors, devout kuo-toa that act as the archpriest's eyes and ears. Monitors are deadly hand-to-hand combatants, and lesser kuo-toa live in fear of them.<br/><br/><b>Kuo-toa Gear.</b> Many weapons of the kuo-toa are designed to capture rather than kill. Nets are common, though some carry pincer staffs (also called mancatchers) designed to trap and immobilize foes. Kuo-toa warriors also treat their shields with a sticky goo that catches incoming weapons.<br/>In general, kuo-toa don't like the weight of armor on their slippery bodies and rely on their natural rubbery hides for protection.

Their hut villages thrive in forbidding grottos, half-sunken ruins, and watery caverns.<br/><br/><b>Territorial Xenophobes.</b> Lizardfolk deal and trade with other races only rarely. Fiercely territorial, they use camouflaged scouts to guard the perimeter of their domain. When unwelcome visitors are detected, a tribe sends a hunting band to harass or drive the trespassers off, or tricks them into blundering into the lairs of crocodiles and other dangerous creatures.<br/>Lizardfolk have no notion of traditional morality, and they find the concepts of good and evil utterly alien. Truly neutral creatures, they kill when it is expedient and do whatever it takes to survive.<br/>Lizardfolk rarely stray beyond their claimed hunting grounds. Any creature that enters their territory is fair game to be stalked, killed, and devoured. They make no distinction between humanoids, beasts, and monsters. Similarly, lizardfolk don't like reaching too far beyond their borders, where they could easily become the hunted instead of the hunters.<br/>Occasions might arise when lizardfolk will form alliances with their neighbors. These lizardfolk usually learn firsthand that humans, dwarves, halflings, and elves can sometimes prove helpful or trustworthy. Once lizardfolk forge ties with outsiders, they are steadfast and fierce allies.<br/><br/><b>Great Feasts and Sacrifices.</b> Lizardfolk are omnivorous, but they have a taste for humanoid flesh. Prisoners are often taken back to their camps to become the centerpieces of great feasts and rites involving dancing, storytelling, and ritual combat. Victims are either cooked and eaten by the tribe, or are sacrificed to Semuanya, the lizardfolk god.<br/><br/><b>Canny Crafters.</b> Though they aren't skilled artisans, lizardfolk craft tools and ornamental jewelry out of the bones of their kills, and they use the hides and shells of dead monsters to create shields.<br/><br/><b>Lizardfolk Leaders.</b> Lizardfolk respect and fear magic with a religious awe. Lizardfolk shamans lead their tribes, overseeing rites and ceremonies performed to honor Semuanya. From time to time, however, a lizardfolk tribe produces a powerful figure touched not by Semuanya but by Sess'inek-a reptilian demon lord who seeks to corrupt and control the lizardfolk.<br/>Lizardfolk born in Sess'inek's image are larger and more cunning than other lizardfolk, and are thoroughly evil. These lizard kings and queens dominate lizardfolk tribes, usurping a shaman's authority and inspiring uncharacteristic aggression among their subjects.<br/><br/><b>Dragon Worshipers.</b> Lizardfolk speak Draconic, which they are thought to have learned from dragons in ancient times. A tribe that wanders into the territory of a dragon will offer it tribute to win its favor. An evil dragon might exploit lizardfolk for its own vile ends, turning them into raiders and plunderers.","environments":["forest","Swamp"],"image":true,"page":204},{"index":"mage","name":"Mage","size":"Medium","type":"humanoid","subtype":"any race","alignment":"any alignment","armor_class":12,"hit_points":40,"hit_dice":"9d8","speed":{"walk":"30 ft."},"strength":9,"dexterity":14,"constitution":11,"intelligence":17,"wisdom":12,"charisma":11,"proficiencies":[{"value":6,"name":"Saving Throw: INT"},{"value":4,"name":"Saving Throw: WIS"},{"value":6,"name":"Skill: Arcana"},{"value":6,"name":"Skill: History"}],"damage_vulnerabilities":[],"damage_resistances":[],"damage_immunities":[],"condition_immunities":[],"senses":{"passive_perception":11},"languages":"any four languages","challenge_rating":6,"xp":2300,"special_abilities":[{"name":"Spellcasting","desc":"The mage is a 9th-level spellcaster.

Psionic tyrants, slavers, and interdimensional voyagers, they are insidious masterminds that harvest entire races for their own twisted ends. Four tentacles snake from their octopus-like heads, flexing in hungry anticipation when sentient creatures come near.<br/>In eons past, illithids controlled empires that spanned many worlds. They subjugated and consequently warped whole races of humanoid slaves, including the githyanki and githzerai, the grimlocks, and the kuo-toa. Conjoined by a collective consciousness, the illithids hatch plots as far-reaching and evil as their fathomless minds can conceive.<br/>Since the fall of their empires, illithid collectives on the Material Plane have resided in the Underdark.<br/><br/><b>Psionic Commanders.</b> Mind flayers possess psionic powers that enable them to control the minds of creatures such as troglodytes, grimlocks, quaggoths, and ogres. Illithids prefer to communicate via telepathy and use their telepathy when issuing commands to their thralls.<br/>When an illithid meets strong resistance, it avoids initial combat as it orders its thralls to attack. Like physical extensions of the illithid's thoughts, these thralls interpose themselves between the mind flayer and its foes, sacrificing their lives so that their master can escape.<br/><br/><b>Hive Mind Colonies.</b> Solitary mind flayers are likely rogues and outcasts. Most illithids belong to a colony of sibling mind flayers devoted to an elder brain-a massive brain-like being that resides in a briny pool near the center of a mind flayer community. From its pool, an elder brain telepathically dictates its desires to each individual mind flayer within 5 miles of it, for it is able to hold multiple mental conversations at once.<br/><br/><b>Hunger of the Mind.</b> Illithids subsist on the brains of humanoids. The brains provide enzymes, hormones, and psychic energy necessary for their survival. An illithid healthy from a brain-rich diet secretes a thin glaze of mucus that coats its mauve skin.<br/>An illithid experiences euphoria as it devours the brain of a humanoid, along with its memories, personality, and innermost fears. Mind flayers will sometimes harvest a brain rather than devour it, using it as part of some alien experiment or transforming it into an intellect devourer.","environments":["underdark"],"image":true,"page":222},{"index":"minotaur","name":"Minotaur","size":"Large","type":"monstrosity","subtype":null,"alignment":"chaotic evil","armor_class":14,"hit_points":76,"hit_dice":"9d10","speed":{"walk":"40 ft."},"strength":18,"dexterity":11,"constitution":16,"intelligence":6,"wisdom":16,"charisma":9,"proficiencies":[{"value":7,"name":"Skill: Perception"}],"damage_vulnerabilities":[],"damage_resistances":[],"damage_immunities":[],"condition_immunities":[],"senses":{"darkvision":"60 ft.","passive_perception":17},"languages":"Abyssal","challenge_rating":3,"xp":700,"special_abilities":[{"name":"Charge","desc":"If the minotaur moves at least 10 ft. straight toward a target and then hits it with a gore attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 9 (2d8) piercing damage.

Born into the mortal realm by demonic rites, minotaurs are savage conquerors and carnivores that live for the hunt.

A minotaur can visualize every route it might take to close the distance to its prey.<br/>The scent of blood, the tearing of flesh, and the cracking of bones spur a minotaur's lust for carnage, overwhelming all thought and reason. In a blood rage, a minotaur charges anything it sees, butting and goring like a battering ram, then chopping the fallen in twain. Apart from ambushing creatures that wander into its labyrinth, a minotaur cares little for strategy or tactics. Minotaurs seldom organize, they don't respect authority or hierarchy, and they are notoriously difficult to enslave, let alone control.<br/><br/><b>Cults of the Horned King.</b> Minotaurs are the dark descendants of humanoids transformed by the rituals of cults that reject the oppression of authority by returning to nature.

In the end, however, sacrificial animals are exchanged for humanoid sacrifice-sometimes an inductee that tried to escape the cult after learning its secrets. These labyrinths become blood-soaked halls of slaughter, echoing to the cultists' savagery.<br/>Unknown to all but their highest-ranking leaders, these mystery cults are creations of the demon lord Baphomet, the Horned King, whose layer of the Abyss is a gigantic labyrinth. Some of his followers are fervent supplicants that plead for strength and power. Others come to the cult seeking a life free from authority's chains-and are liberated of their humanity instead as Baphomet transforms them into the minotaurs that echo his own savage form.<br/>Although they begin as creations of the Horned King, minotaurs can breed true with one another, giving rise to an independent race of Baphomet's savage children in the world.","environments":["underdark"],"image":true,"page":223},{"index":"minotaur-skeleton","name":"Minotaur Skeleton","size":"Large","type":"undead","subtype":null,"alignment":"lawful evil","armor_class":12,"hit_points":67,"hit_dice":"9d10","speed":{"walk":"40 ft."},"strength":18,"dexterity":11,"constitution":15,"intelligence":6,"wisdom":8,"charisma":5,"proficiencies":[],"damage_vulnerabilities":["bludgeoning"],"damage_resistances":[],"damage_immunities":["poison"],"condition_immunities":["exhaustion","poisoned"],"senses":{"darkvision":"60 ft.","passive_perception":9},"languages":"understands Abyssal but can't speak","challenge_rating":2,"xp":450,"special_abilities":[{"name":"Charge","desc":"If the skeleton moves at least 10 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a gore attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 9 (2d8) piercing damage.

Having been awoken from its rest, it punishes transgressors with the power of its unholy curse.<br/><br/><b>Preserved Wrath.</b> The long burial rituals that accompany a mummy's entombment help protect its body from rot. In the embalming process, the newly dead creature's organs are removed and placed in special jars, and its corpse is treated with preserving oils, herbs, and wrappings. After the body has been prepared, the corpse is typically wrapped in linen bandages.<br/><br/><b>The Will of Dark Gods.</b> An undead mummy is created when the priest of a death god or other dark deity ritually imbues a prepared corpse with necromantic magic. The mummy's linen wrappings are inscribed with necromantic markings before the burial ritual concludes with an invocation to darkness. As a mummy endures in undeath, it animates in response to conditions specified by the ritual. Most commonly, a transgression against its tomb, treasures, lands, or former loved ones will cause a mummy to rise.<br/><br/><b>The Punished.</b> Once deceased, an individual has no say in whether or not its body is made into a mummy. Some mummies were powerful individuals who displeased a high priest or pharaoh, or who committed crimes of treason, adultery, or murder. As punishment, they were cursed with eternal undeath, embalmed, mummified, and sealed away. Other times, mummies acting as tomb guardians are created from slaves put to death specifically to serve a greater purpose.<br/><br/><b>Creature of Ritual.</b> A mummy obeys the conditions and parameters laid down by the rituals that created it, driven only to punish transgressors. The overwhelming terror that foreshadows a mummy's attack can leave the intended victim paralyzed with fright. In the days following a mummy's touch, a victim's body rots from the outside in, until nothing but dust remains.<br/><br/><b>Ending a Mummy's Curse.</b> Rare magic can undo or dispel the ritual that gave rise to a mummy, allowing it to truly die. More commonly, a mummy can be sent back to its endless rest by undoing the transgression that caused it to rise. A sacred idol might be replaced in its niche, a stolen treasure could be returned to its tomb, or a temple might be purified of despoiling bloodshed.<br/>More ephemeral or permanent offenses, such as revealing a secret the mummy wished kept or killing an individual the mummy loved, can't be so easily remedied. In such cases, a mummy might slaughter all the creatures responsible and still not sate its wrath.<br/><br/><b>Undead Archives.</b> Though they seldom bother to do so, mummies can speak.

Insults and name-calling can rouse an ogre's wrath in an instant-as can stealing from it, bumping, jabbing, or prodding it, laughing, making faces, or simply looking at it the wrong way.

This macabre crafting is the height of ogre culture.<br/><br/><b>Greedy Collectors.</b> An ogre's eyes glitter with avarice when it sees the possessions of others. Ogres carry rough sacks on their raids, which they fill with fabulous \"treasure\" taken from their victims. This might include a collection of battered helmets, a moldy wheel of cheese, a rough patch of animal fur fastened like a cloak, or a squealing, mud-spattered pig. Ogres also delight in the gleam of gold and silver, and they will fight one another over small handfuls of coins.

Most speak only a rudimentary form of Giant and know a smattering of Common words. Ogres believe what they are told and are easy to fool or confuse, but they break things they don't understand.

The ores believe that in ancient days, the gods gathered to divide the world among their followers. When Gruumsh claimed the mountains, he learned they had been taken by the dwarves. He laid claim to the forests, but those had been settled by the elves. Each place that Gruumsh wanted had already been claimed. The other gods laughed at Gruumsh, but he responded with a furious bellow. Grasping his mighty spear, he laid waste to the mountains, set the forests aflame, and carved great furrows in the fields. Such was the role of the ores, he proclaimed, to take and destroy all that the other races would deny them. To this day, the ores wage an endless war on humans, elves, dwarves, and other folk.<br/>Ores hold a particular hatred for elves. The elven god Corellon Larethian half-blinded Gruumsh with a well­ placed arrow to the ore god's eye. Since then, the ores have taken particularjoy in slaughtering elves. Turning his injury into a baleful gift, Gruumsh grants divine might to any champion who willingly plucks out one of its eyes in his honor.<br/><br/><b>Tribes like Plagues.</b> Ores gather in tribes that exert their dominance and satisfy their bloodlust by plundering villages, devouring or driving off roaming herds, and slaying any humanoids that stand against them. After savaging a settlement, ores pick it clean of wealth and items usable in their own lands. They set the remains of villages and camps ablaze, then retreat whence they came, their bloodlust satisfied.<br/><br/><b>Ranging Scavengers.</b> Their lust for slaughter demands that ores dwell always within striking distance of new targets. As such, they seldom settle permanently, instead converting ruins, cavern complexes, and defeated foes' villages into fortified camps and strongholds. Ores build only for defense, making no innovation or improvement to their lairs beyond mounting the severed body parts of their victims on spiked stockade walls or pikes jutting up from moats and trenches.<br/>When an existing territory is depleted of food, an ore tribe divides into roving bands that scout for choice hunting grounds. When each party returns, it brings back trophies and news of targets ripe for attack, the richest of which is chosen. The tribe then sets out en masse to carve a bloody path to its new territory.<br/>On rare occasions, a tribe's leader chooses to hold onto a particularly defensible lair for decades. The ores of such a tribe must range far across the countryside to sate their appetites.<br/><br/><b>Leadership and Might.</b> Ore tribes are mostly patriarchal, flaunting such vivid or grotesque titles as Many-Arrows, Screaming Eye, and Elf Ripper. Occasionally, a powerful war chief unites scattered ore tribes into a single rampaging horde, which runs roughshod over other ore tribes and humanoid settlements from a position of overwhelming strength.<br/>Strength and power are the greatest of orcish virtues, and ores embrace all manner of mighty creatures in their tribes. Rejecting notions of racial purity, they proudly welcome ogres, trolls, half-ores, and orogs into their ranks. As well, ores respect and fear the size and power of evil giants, and often serve them as guards and soldiers.<br/><br/><b>Ore Crossbreeds.</b> Luthic, the ore goddess of fertility and wife of Gruumsh, demands that ores procreate often and indiscriminately so that ore hordes swell generation after generation. The ores' drive to reproduce runs stronger than any other humanoid race, and they readily crossbreed with other races. When an ore procreates with a non-ore humanoid of similar size and stature (such as a human or a dwarf), the resulting child is either an ore or a half-ore. When an ore produces young with an ogre, the child is a half-ogre of intimidating strength and brutish features called an ogrillon.","environments":["arctic","forest","grassland","hill","mountain","Swamp","underdark"],"image":true,"page":244},{"index":"otyugh","name":"Otyugh","size":"Large","type":"aberration","subtype":null,"alignment":"neutral","armor_class":14,"hit_points":114,"hit_dice":"12d10","speed":{"walk":"30 ft."},"strength":16,"dexterity":11,"constitution":19,"intelligence":6,"wisdom":13,"charisma":6,"proficiencies":[{"value":7,"name":"Saving Throw: CON"}],"damage_vulnerabilities":[],"damage_resistances":[],"damage_immunities":[],"condition_immunities":[],"senses":{"darkvision":"120 ft.","passive_perception":11},"languages":"Otyugh","challenge_rating":5,"xp":1800,"special_abilities":[{"name":"Limited Telepathy","desc":"The otyugh can magically transmit simple messages and images to any creature within 120 ft. of it that can understand a language.

Feathers cover the thick, shaggy coat of its bearlike body, and the limpid pupils of its great round eyes stare furiously from its owlish head.<br/><br/><b>Deadly Ferocity.</b> The owlbear's reputation for ferocity, aggression, stubbornness, and sheer ill temper makes it one of the most feared predators of the wild. There is little, if anything, that a hungry owlbear fears. Even monsters that outmatch an owlbear in size and strength avoid tangling with it, for this creature cares nothing about a foe's superior strength as it attacks without provocation.<br/><br/><b>Consummate Predators.</b> An owlbear emerges from its den around sunset and hunts into the darkest hours of the night, hooting or screeching to declare its territory, to search for a mate, or to flush prey into its hunting grounds. These are typically forests familiar to the owlbear, and dense enough to limit its quarry's escape routes.<br/>An owlbear makes its den in a cave or ruin littered with the bones of its prey. It drags partially devoured kills back to its den, storing portions of the carcass among the surrounding rocks, bushes, and trees. The scent of blood and rotting flesh hangs heavy near an owlbear's lair, attracting scavengers and thus luring more prey.<br/>Owlbears hunt alone or in mated pairs. If quarry is plentiful, a family of owlbears might remain together for longer than is required to rear offspring. Otherwise, they part ways as soon as the young are ready to hunt.<br/><br/><b>Savage Companions.</b> Although they are more intelligent than most animals, owlbears are difficult to tame. However, with enough time, food, and luck, an intelligent creature can train an owlbear to recognize it as a master, making it an unflinching guard or a fast and hardy mount. People of remote frontier settlements have even succeeded at racing owlbears, but spectators bet as often on which owlbear will attack its handler as they do on which will reach the finish line first.<br/>Elven communities encourage owlbears to den beneath their treetop villages, using the beasts as a natural defense during the night. Hobgoblins favor owlbears as war beasts, and hill giants and frost giants sometimes keep owlbears as pets.

They heed the summons of spellcasters who call them from their stony tombs and ancient battlefields, or rise of their own accord in places saturated with death and loss, awakened by stirrings of necromantic energy or the presence of corrupting evil.<br/><br/><b>Animated Dead.</b> Whatever sinister force awakens a skeleton infuses its bones with a dark vitality, adhering joint to joint and reassembling dismantled limbs. This energy motivates a skeleton to move and think in a rudimentary fashion, though only as a pale imitation of the way it behaved in life. An animated skeleton retains no connection to its past, although resurrecting a skeleton restores it body and soul, banishing the hateful undead spirit that empowers it.<br/>While most skeletons are the animated remains of dead humans and other humanoids, skeletal undead can be created from the bones of other creatures besides humanoids, giving rise to a host of terrifying and unique forms.<br/><br/><b>Obedient Servants.</b> Skeletons raised by spell are bound to the will of their creator. They follow orders to the letter, never questioning the tasks their masters give them, regardless of the consequences. Because of their literal interpretation of commands and unwavering obedience, skeletons adapt poorly to changing circumstances. They can't read, speak, emote, or communicate in any way except to nod, shake their heads, or point. Still, skeletons are able to accomplish a variety of relatively complex tasks.<br/>A skeleton can fight with weapons and wear armor, can load and fire a catapult or trebuchet, scale a siege ladder, form a shield wall, or dump boiling oil. However, it must receive careful instructions explaining how such tasks are accomplished.<br/>Although they lack the intellect they possessed in life, skeletons aren't mindless. Rather than break its limbs attempting to batter its way through an iron door, a skeleton tries the handle first. If that doesn't work, it searches for another way through or around the obstacle.<br/><br/><b>Habitual Behaviors.</b> Independent skeletons temporarily or permanently free of a master's control sometimes pantomime actions from their past lives, their bones echoing the rote behaviors of their former living selves. The skeleton of a miner might lift a pick and start chipping away at stone walls. The skeleton of a guard might strike up a post at a random doorway. The skeleton of a dragon might lie down on a pile of treasure, while the skeleton of a horse crops grass it can't eat. Left alone in a ballroom, the skeletons of nobles might continue an eternally unfinished dance.<br/>When skeletons encounter living creatures, the necromantic energy that drives them compels them to kill unless they are commanded by their masters to refrain from doing so. They attack without mercy and fight until destroyed, for skeletons possess little sense of self and even less sense of self-preservation.<br/><br/><b>Undead Nature.</b> A skeleton doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.","environments":["urban"],"image":true,"page":272},{"index":"solar","name":"Solar","size":"Large","type":"celestial","subtype":null,"alignment":"lawful good","armor_class":21,"hit_points":243,"hit_dice":"18d10","speed":{"walk":"50 ft.","fly":"150 ft."},"strength":26,"dexterity":22,"constitution":26,"intelligence":25,"wisdom":25,"charisma":30,"proficiencies":[{"value":14,"name":"Saving Throw: INT"},{"value":14,"name":"Saving Throw: WIS"},{"value":17,"name":"Saving Throw: CHA"},{"value":14,"name":"Skill: Perception"}],"damage_vulnerabilities":[],"damage_resistances":["radiant","bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical weapons"],"damage_immunities":["necrotic","poison"],"condition_immunities":["charmed","exhaustion","frightened","poisoned"],"senses":{"truesight":"120 ft.","passive_perception":24},"languages":"all, telepathy 120 ft.","challenge_rating":21,"xp":33000,"special_abilities":[{"name":"Angelic Weapons","desc":"The solar's weapon attacks are magical.

Asmodeus, ruler of the Nine Hells, uses these fiends to tempt mortals to perform evil acts. The demon lord Graz'zt keeps succubi and incubi as advisers and consorts.<br/>Though legend speaks of them separately, any succubus can become an incubus, and vice versa. Most of these fiends do have a preference for one form or the other. Mortals only rarely see a succubus or incubus in its true form, however, for the fiend typically begins its corruption in veiled, insidious ways.<br/><br/><b>Beautiful Corrupters.</b> A succubus or incubus first appears in ethereal form, passing through walls like a ghost to lurk next to a mortal's bedside and whisper forbidden pleasures. Sleeping victims are tempted to give in to their darkest desires, indulge in taboos, and feed forbidden appetites. As the fiend fills the victim's dreams with debauched images, the victim becomes more susceptible to temptation in everyday life.<br/>Inevitably, the fiend enters the mortal realm in tempting form to directly influence a creature's actions. Appearing in the guise of a humanoid who has previously appeared only in the victim's dreams, the succubus or incubus seduces or befriends its victim, indulging all its desires so that it performs evil acts of its own free will.<br/>A mortal bequeaths its soul to the fiend not by formal pledge or contract. Instead, when a succubus or incubus has corrupted a creature completely-some say by causing the victim to commit the three betrayals of thought, word, and deed-the victim's soul belongs to the fiend. The more virtuous the fiend's prey, the longer the corruption takes, but the more rewarding the downfall. After successfully corrupting a victim, the succubus or incubus kills it, and the tainted soul descends into the Lower Planes.<br/>The succubus or incubus resorts to charming a victim magically only when necessary, usually as a form of self-defense. A charmed creature isn't responsible for its actions, so forcing it to behave against its will won't bring the fiend closer to the ultimate prize: the victim's soul.<br/><br/><b>Deadly Kiss.</b> The kiss of a succubus or incubus is an echo of the emptiness that is the fiend's longing for a corrupted soul. Likewise, the recipient of the fiend's kiss gains no satisfaction from it, experiencing only pain and the profound emptiness that the fiend imparts. The kiss is nothing short of an attack, usually delivered as a final farewell before the fiend escapes.<br/><br/><b>Fiendish Offspring.</b> Succubi and incubi can reproduce with one another to spawn more of their kind. Less commonly, a succubus or incubus reproduces with a humanoid. From this unholy union, a cambion child is conceived. Invariably, the fiendish offspring is as wicked as its fiendish parent.","environments":["urban"],"image":true,"page":285},{"index":"swarm-of-bats","name":"Swarm of Bats","size":"Medium","type":"swarm of Tiny beasts","subtype":null,"alignment":"unaligned","armor_class":12,"hit_points":22,"hit_dice":"5d8","speed":{"walk":"0 ft.","fly":"30 ft."},"strength":5,"dexterity":15,"constitution":10,"intelligence":2,"wisdom":12,"charisma":4,"proficiencies":[],"damage_vulnerabilities":[],"damage_resistances":["bludgeoning","piercing","slashing"],"damage_immunities":[],"condition_immunities":["charmed","frightened","grappled","paralyzed","petrified","prone","restrained","stunned"],"senses":{"blindsight":"60 ft.","passive_perception":11},"languages":"","challenge_rating":0.25,"xp":50,"special_abilities":[{"name":"Echolocation","desc":"The swarm can't use its blindsight while deafened."},{"name":"Keen Hearing","desc":"The swarm has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing."},{"name":"Swarm","desc":"The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny bat.

Unrelated to the horses it resembles, a unicorn is a celestial creature that wanders sylvan realms, its white form glimmering like starlight.<br/>A unicorn's brow sports a single spiraling horn of ivory whose magical touch can heal the sick and the injured. Its ears catch the words and whispers of the creatures that share its domain, and it knows the tongues of elves and sylvan folk. Unicorns allow good-hearted creatures to enter their woods to hunt or gather food, but they hold evil ever at bay. Foul-hearted creatures seldom leave a unicorn's domain alive.<br/><br/><b>Divine Guardians.</b> Good deities placed unicorns on the Material Plane to ward away evil and preserve and protect sacred places. Most unicorns protect a bounded realm such as an enchanted forest. However, the gods sometimes send a unicorn to guard sacred artifacts or protect specific creatures. When the forces of darkness strike against an individual the gods wish to protect, they might send that individual to a unicorn's forest, where evil creatures pursue at their peril.<br/>Unicorns most often serve deities of the forest and woodlands, including the gods of benevolent fey. Although all unicorns have natural healing power, some serve the gods in greater capacities, performing miracles normally reserved for high priests.<br/><br/><b>Forest Lords.</b> A unicorn's forest is a celestial realm where nothing that occurs beneath the sun-dappled leaves escapes the creature's notice. A unicorn hears each breathy tune sung by the elves that reside amid the treetops. It senses where every caterpillar spins its cocoon, each leaf and branch upon which a bright butterfly rests its tired wings.<br/>In a unicorn's forest, a sense of calm pervades. From wolves and foxes to birds, squirrels, and tiny insects, the creatures of a unicorn's domain seem quite tame. Pixies, sprites, satyrs, dryads, and other normally mercurial fey loyally serve a unicorn when they dwell within its woods. Under a unicorn's protection, creatures feel safe from the threat of encroaching civilization and the insidious spread of evil.<br/>A unicorn roams its domain constantly, moving ever so carefully so as not to disturb other denizens. A creature might catch a passing glimpse of the unicorn then suddenly see nothing but the wild woods.<br/><br/><b>Sacred Horns.</b> A unicorn's horn is the focus of its power, a shard of divine magic wrought in spiraling ivory. Wands of unicorn horn channel powerful magic, while unicorn horn weapons strike with divine force. Wizards can work powdered unicorn horn into potent potions and scroll ink, or use it as a component in eldritch rituals. However, any creature that takes a role, no matter how small, in slaying a unicorn is likely to become the target of divine retribution.<br/><br/><b>Blessed Mounts.</b> When darkness and evil threaten to overwhelm the mortal world, the gods sometimes see fit to pair a unicorn mount with a champion. A paladin astride a unicorn is a sign of the gods' direct intervention in the affairs of the mortal realm. It is a holy alliance made to cleave the heads from demons and banish devils back to the Nine Hells.<br/>As long as the troubled times of darkness persist, the unicorn stays by the champion, its horn shining brightly to drive back the night. However, if the gods' champion falls from grace or turns from the cause of righteousness and good, the unicorn departs, never to return.","environments":["forest"],"image":true,"page":293},{"index":"vampire","name":"Vampire","size":"Medium","type":"undead","subtype":"shapechanger","alignment":"lawful evil","armor_class":16,"hit_points":144,"hit_dice":"17d8","speed":{"walk":"30 ft."},"strength":18,"dexterity":18,"constitution":18,"intelligence":17,"wisdom":15,"charisma":18,"proficiencies":[{"value":9,"name":"Saving Throw: DEX"},{"value":7,"name":"Saving Throw: WIS"},{"value":9,"name":"Saving Throw: CHA"},{"value":7,"name":"Skill: Perception"},{"value":9,"name":"Skill: Stealth"}],"damage_vulnerabilities":[],"damage_resistances":["necrotic","bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical weapons"],"damage_immunities":[],"condition_immunities":[],"senses":{"darkvision":"120 ft.","passive_perception":17},"languages":"the languages it knew in life","challenge_rating":13,"xp":10000,"special_abilities":[{"name":"Shapechanger","desc":"If the vampire isn't in sun light or running water, it can use its action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into its true form.\nWhile in bat form, the vampire can't speak, its walking speed is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet.

They retreat to barrow mounds, crypts, and tombs where they dwell.

Motivated by hunger for living souls and driven by the same desire for power that awakened them in undeath, some wights serve as shock troops for evil leaders, including wraiths. As soldiers, they are able to plan but seldom do so, relying on their hunger for destruction to overwhelm any creature that stands before them.<br/><br/><b>Undead Nature.</b> A wight doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.","environments":["desert","Swamp","underdark","urban"],"image":true,"page":300},{"index":"will-o-wisp","name":"Will-o'-Wisp","size":"Tiny","type":"undead","subtype":null,"alignment":"chaotic evil","armor_class":19,"hit_points":22,"hit_dice":"9d4","speed":{"walk":"0 ft.","fly":"50 ft.","hover":true},"strength":1,"dexterity":28,"constitution":10,"intelligence":13,"wisdom":14,"charisma":11,"proficiencies":[],"damage_vulnerabilities":[],"damage_resistances":["acid","cold","fire","necrotic","thunder","bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical weapons"],"damage_immunities":["lightning","poison"],"condition_immunities":["exhaustion","grappled","paralyzed","poisoned","prone","restrained","unconscious"],"senses":{"darkvision":"120 ft.","passive_perception":12},"languages":"the languages it knew in life","challenge_rating":2,"xp":450,"special_abilities":[{"name":"Consume Life","desc":"As a bonus action, the will-o'-wisp can target one creature it can see within 5 ft. of it that has 0 hit points and is still alive.

They take the forms of friendly animals to observe other creatures of interest. They are also fascinated by warfare and eagerly join armies fighting for a just cause.<br/>A ribbed and fluted crest defines the shape of a bronze dragon's head. Curving horns extend out from the crest, echoed by spines on its lower jaw and chin. To help them swim, bronze dragons have webbed feet and smooth scales. A bronze wyrmling's scales are yellow tinged with green; only as the dragon approaches adulthood does its color deepen to a darker, rich bronze tone. The pupils of a bronze dragon's eyes fade as the dragon ages, until they resemble glowing green orbs.<br/><br/><b>Dragons of the Coast.</b> Bronze dragons love to watch ships traveling up and down the coastlines near their lairs, sometimes taking the forms of dolphins or seagulls to inspect those ships and their crews more closely. A daring bronze dragon might slip aboard a ship in the guise of a bird or rat, inspecting the hold for treasure. If the dragon finds a worthy addition to its hoard, it barters with the ship's captain for the item.<br/><br/><b>War Machines.</b> Bronze dragons actively oppose tyranny, and many bronze dragons yearn to test their mettle by putting their size and strength to good use.<br/>When a conflict unfolds near its lair, a bronze dragon ascertains the underlying cause, then offers its services to any side that fights for good. Once a bronze dragon commits to a cause, it remains a staunch ally.<br/><br/><b>Well-Organized Wealth.</b> Bronze dragons loot sunken ships and also collect colorful coral and pearls from the reefs and sea beds near their lairs. When a bronze dragon pledges to help an army wage war against tyranny, it asks for nominal payment. If such a request is beyond its allies' means, it might settle for a collection of old books on military history or a ceremonial item commemorating the alliance. A bronze dragon might also lay claim to a treasure held by the enemy that it feels would be safer under its protection.","environments":["coastal"],"image":true,"page":108},{"index":"young-copper-dragon","name":"Young Copper Dragon","size":"Large","type":"dragon","subtype":null,"alignment":"chaotic good","armor_class":17,"hit_points":119,"hit_dice":"14d10","speed":{"walk":"40 ft.","climb":"40 ft.","fly":"80 ft."},"strength":19,"dexterity":12,"constitution":17,"intelligence":16,"wisdom":13,"charisma":15,"proficiencies":[{"value":4,"name":"Saving Throw: DEX"},{"value":6,"name":"Saving Throw: CON"},{"value":4,"name":"Saving Throw: WIS"},{"value":5,"name":"Saving Throw: CHA"},{"value":5,"name":"Skill: Deception"},{"value":7,"name":"Skill: Perception"},{"value":4,"name":"Skill: Stealth"}],"damage_vulnerabilities":[],"damage_resistances":[],"damage_immunities":["acid"],"condition_immunities":[],"senses":{"blindsight":"30 ft.","darkvision":"120 ft.","passive_perception":17},"languages":"Common, Draconic","challenge_rating":7,"xp":2900,"actions":[{"name":"Multiattack","desc":"The dragon makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws."},{"name":"Bite","desc":"Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.

The zombie advances, driven to kill anyone too slow to escape its grasp.<br/><br/><b>Dark Servants.</b> Sinister necromantic magic infuses the remains of the dead, causing them to rise as zombies that do their creator's bidding without fear or hesitation. They move with a jerky, uneven gait, clad in the moldering apparel they wore when put to rest, and carrying the stench of decay.<br/>Most zombies are made from humanoid remains, though the flesh and bones of any formerly living creature can be imbued with a semblance of life. Necromantic magic, usually from spells, animates a zombie. Some zombies rise spontaneously when dark magic saturates an area. Once turned into a zombie, a creature can't be restored to life except by powerful magic, such as a resurrection spell.<br/>A zombie retains no vestiges of its former self, its mind devoid of thought and imagination. A zombie left without orders simply stands in place and rots unless something comes along that it can kill. The magic animating a zombie imbues it with evil, so left without purpose, it attacks any living creature it encounters.<br/><br/><b>Hideous Forms.</b> Zombies appear as they did in life, showing the wounds that killed them. However, the magic that creates these vile creatures often takes time to run its course. Dead warriors might rise from a battlefield, eviscerated and bloated after days in the sun. The muddy cadaver of a peasant could claw its way from the ground, riddled with maggots and worms. A zombie might wash ashore or rise from a marsh, swollen and reeking after weeks in the water.<br/><br/><b>Mindless Soldiers.</b> Zombies take the most direct route to any foe, unable to comprehend obstacles, tactics, or dangerous terrain. A zombie might stumble into a fast-flowing river to reach foes on a far shore, clawing at the surface as it is battered against rocks and destroyed. To reach a foe below it, a zombie might step out of an open window. Zombies stumble through roaring infernos, into pools of acid, and across fields littered with caltrops without hesitation.<br/>A zombie can follow simple orders and distinguish friends from foes, but its ability to reason is limited to shambling in whatever direction it is pointed, pummeling any enemy in its path. A zombie armed with a weapon uses it, but the zombie won't retrieve a dropped weapon or other tool until told to do so.<br/><br/><b>Undead Nature.</b> A zombie doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.","environments":["urban"],"image":true,"page":315}]
